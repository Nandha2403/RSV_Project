                  RSV has an HTML5/Web-based import module referred to as
                  RadGate that sites use to upload data into the system. Site
                  users (or anyone with site-specific upload access) log in and
                  select a patient or timepoint to upload. The user selects a
                  folder or files to upload, and the upload module processes
                  these files and presents the user with a summary manifest of
                  what will be uploaded, excluding data that is extraneous
                  (e.g., ".exe" files). This form can be configured to ask for
                  additional data if necessary (not in the headers). A viewer is
                  also available that can be used to view the images prior to
                  transmittal (this step can be a requirement or optional). The
                  user is presented with a Data Transmittal Form (DTF), signs
                  the DTF, and the transfer of images starts.

                  As the images are transferred, they are blinded and anonymized
                  based on study configurations. RadGate also checks for
                  duplicates, "bad" DICOM files, etc., runs edit checks to check
                  for data issues (e.g., wrong modality, incorrect acquisition
                  parameters if configured, etc.), and can automatically create
                  Data Clarification Forms (DCFs) or Protocol Deviations (PDs)
                  that have to be addressed by the site/corelab staff. Once all
                  the images are uploaded, a copy of the DTF is sent to the site
                  for their records, and the uploaded content is added to the
                  studyâ€™s workflow (Eligibility, QC, etc.) with automated
                  notification to users that new data has arrived and needs to
                  be processed. The module also has features to import non-DICOM
                  data and hardcopy film, along with a myriad of other features.

                  RSV's AI model for anatomical brain assessment processes T1
                  brain scans and segments over 80 regions of the brain in less
                  than 90 seconds. Volumes of each region are calculated along
                  with total brain volumes to detect changes in volumes across
                  timepoints.

                  CLIB supports the upload of image files (JPG, PNG) from
                  external sources and links them to subjects in a study.
                  Uploaded images follow a similar process and undergo QC before
                  being made available for assessments. Assessments can be
                  qualitative or quantitative. RSV has also developed a
                  Smartphone App for Android as well as Apple phones, enabling
                  participating subjects to take images at home and
                  automatically upload them to CLIB.

                  The app supports interactive help to assist subjects during
                  image acquisition. Additionally, the app facilitates image QC
                  and analysis on the phone before upload, improving the quality
                  of acquired images. The App also supports a patient-centric
                  eCRF (e.g., QOL form, etc.) to capture responses directly from
                  patients. RSV is also exploring the use of AI to enhance the
                  patient experience.

                  RSV offers an Event Adjudication platform that combines
                  modules in CLIB to deliver a unique and customizable solution
                  to adjudicate events and support safety committees. RadEvent
                  supports the upload of essential documents, files, and images,
                  along with additional content to create a dossier for each
                  event to be assessed.

                  Uploaded content is QCed, including features for redaction,
                  translation, merging, splitting, and concatenating of
                  documents as needed. Custom workflows can be set up to process
                  any of the uploaded data. Once dossiers are created, experts
                  can review the dossier and respond to eCRF questions.
                  Assessments can be compared, and further reads can be
                  performed. RadEvent also supports real-time consensus reads
                  with multiple signatures.
